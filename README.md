# Paalam üåâ

Paalam is a comprehensive system designed for the **Dr. Beema Clinic for Child Development**. It aims to bridge the gap between patients and providers by enabling therapists, supervisors, and staff to track therapy sessions, monitor progress, and manage activities effectively. The system adheres to standards like ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) and IBT (Individualized Behavioral Therapy).

Paalam, meaning bridge in Malayalam, will bridge the gap between patients, guardians, and hospital staff in organization.

## üåü Purpose

The primary goal of Paalam is to streamline therapy management and reporting for child development clinics. Key features include:

- **Session Tracking**: Record and monitor therapy sessions for patients.
- **Activity Management**: Log activities performed during sessions, categorized by therapy type.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Enable supervisors to generate reports and track patient progress.
- **Staff and Patient Management**: Manage staff roles, schedules, and patient assignments.
- **Medication Tracking**: Track prescribed medicines for patients.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Paalam is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) with GORM for database interactions and Fiber for the web framework.
- **Frontend**: Astro with integrations for React and Vue.
- **Database**: MySQL.
