  summary: Bridges the gap between patient and provider.
  description: |
    This is a system to track therapy sessions, initially built for use at Dr. Beema Clinic for Child Development. Following either ABA or IBT standards, therapists can report and monitor progress of a child patient, while supervisors can also generate reports and monitor the activities made.
    Activities are split into categories based on the individualized forms of therapy assigned.
